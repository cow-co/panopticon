# PANOPTICON

An app for visualising your digital footprint

## Disclaimer

- I **do not** collect *any* telemetry or personal information via this app. The app does not connect to the internet (has been tested in an isolated VM)
- I have zero use for your personal information, and wouldn't want the legal obligations anyway.

## About

- PANOPTICON allows you to visualise the extent of your digital footprint.
- It will not search for usages of your information on the internet etc.
  - This would require me to collect your PII (see Disclaimer)
  - Other services do this better than I ever could
- Idea is that you can place entities representing the information you have provided to various locations
- You can then put relationships between them (eg. X email is listed publicly on LinkedIn)
- Basic inference logic can then allow you to see how someone could traverse various sites to build up a picture of your information
